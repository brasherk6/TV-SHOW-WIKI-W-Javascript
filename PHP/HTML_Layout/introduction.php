    <h1>Outer Range</h1>
    <p> <i>Outer Range</i> centers on Royal Abbott (Josh Brolin), a rancher fighting for his land and family,
        who discovers an unfathomable mystery at the edge of Wyoming's wilderness. A thrilling fable with hints of
        wry humor and supernatural mystery, Outer Range examines how we grapple with the unknown. <br> <br>

        At the onset of the series, the Abbotts are coping with the disappearance of daughter-in-law Rebecca. They
        are pushed further to the brink when the Tillersons (the gaudy owners of the neighboring profit-driven ranch)
        make a play for their land. An untimely death in the community sets off a chain of tension-filled events, and
        seemingly small-town, soil-bound troubles come to a head with the arrival of a mysterious black void in the
        Abbotts’ west pasture. Wild revelations unfold as Royal fights to protect his family; through his eyes, we begin
        to see how time contains secrets held in the past and unsettling mysteries foreshadowed. <br> <br>
